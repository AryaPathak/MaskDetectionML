Especially after covid situations these projects have real life significance. Loved to build this application...


The dataset is given to CNN class VGG16 to train the model.
It is a classifier kind of machine learning model which classifies between two categories as mask and no mask. 
Transfer learning is used in which the model is trained according to the previous knowledge.

It depends on the quality and the quantity of the dataset whether the app is predicted correctly or not. 

The total accuracy of the model I prepared came out to be 96% which is pretty fine.
